      <p>Science is the information about the earth, environmental factors and condition and the living creatures included. Science offers new data and disclosures of numerous things we don’t have a simple or naive idea.

        Step by step, science is advancing. Presently science has helped man arrive at the moon, which was once obscure to man as a satellite. Each creation in innovation or clinical methods depends on science and logical examination.</p>

        <h4>Implemented Online Attendence Management System</h4>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
          Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
          <br>
          2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
          <br>
          3. Productivity / Efficiency
           Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
